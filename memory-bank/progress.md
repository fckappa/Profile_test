# Progress

This document tracks the current status of the Profile_test project, what works, what's left to build, and known issues. It also documents the evolution of project decisions.

## Current Status
The memory bank has been successfully initialized. All core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated with initial content.

## What Works
- The `memory-bank` directory structure is in place.
- Foundational project documentation is established, providing a clear context for future development.

## What's Left to Build
- Actual UI components and features for the profile testing environment.
- Specific experiments and prototypes as defined by future tasks.
- Integration with any external tools or APIs if required by experiments.

## Known Issues
- None at this initial stage. The project is a blank canvas for experimentation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Decision:** To create a comprehensive memory bank from the outset to ensure clear documentation and context for all future work, especially given the agent's memory reset characteristic. This decision has been successfully implemented.
