# Tech Context

This document details the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns within the Profile_test project.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For semantic markup and page structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling, including Flexbox/Grid for layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For dynamic behavior and client-side logic.

## Development Setup
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (as indicated by environment details).
- **Browser:** Any modern web browser for testing.
- **Local Server:** A simple local server (e.g., VS Code's Live Server extension, or `python -m http.server`) can be used to serve `index.html` if needed for certain features (e.g., fetching local JSON files).

## Technical Constraints
- **Client-Side Only:** No server-side logic or database interactions are planned for the initial phase.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Focus on modern browser compatibility; no specific legacy browser support is a primary concern.
- **Performance:** Keep assets lightweight and JavaScript execution efficient, even for a testing environment.

## Dependencies
- Currently, no external JavaScript libraries or CSS frameworks are explicitly used. The project aims to be dependency-free for maximum control and learning.
- Future experiments might introduce small, focused libraries (e.g., for charting, animation, or state management) as needed.

## Tool Usage Patterns
- **File System Operations:** `mkdir`, `touch` for creating directories and files.
- **Code Editing:** Direct editing of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Browser Testing:** Using a web browser to view and interact with the `index.html` file.
- **Version Control:** Git for tracking changes (as indicated by `.git/` directory and `latestGitCommitHash`).
